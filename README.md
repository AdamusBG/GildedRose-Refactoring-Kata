## Java

I have worked on the kata in Java, please navigate [here](https://github.com/AdamusBG/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/Java) to see my solution.  

To run the tests, please navigate to the Java directory (/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/Java) after cloning this repo to your computer and enter the following:

```
$ gradle test
$ open ./build/reports/tests/test/index.html
```

This will open a browser page with reports on my tests - note that the 'gradle test' command may take some time to run.  

If you are unable to use gradle, it may not be installed on your computer. See [this](https://gradle.org/install/) website for help installing gradle and [this](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/run-junit-from-command-line/) website for information on JUnit testing with Gradle from the command line.
